# A react-redux-webpack-karma-mocha-chai-sinon-webdriver-selenium front-end web application

This is post goes into details about how to wire up a simple front-end app with
some nice frameworks, so you donâ€™t have to figure some chore-some things out
yourself.

## Creating the application (basics)

1. Use [IntelliJ] for the greater good. Start a project using the â€™Static Web
-> Static Web` component.

1. Next, run `npm init` to generate a `package.json` file in the repository.

    - You donâ€™t have to fill in anything for now for the `test` option
    - Ensure that the `entry point` option is set to `server.js`
    - The `package.json` file should be created.

    [npm], as a package manager, helps us (JS devs) save our code as packages
    for easy reusing. Our `package.json` [file][package.json] contains a list
    of packages that we will be using as dependencies for our application.

    Other developers can install all dependencies we list in the file by simply
    running `npm install`, which is pretty neat. :)

1. Weâ€™ll use [Express] to serve our application. Run `npm install express -S`
(same as the `â€”-save` option) to save it as a dependency.

1. Subsequently weâ€™ll need to create a `server.js` file to point express to.
Set it up like

	```
	// server.js file
	const Express = require('express');
	const app = new Express();

	app.use((req, res) => {
	    res.sendFile(`${__dirname}/index.html`);
	});

	app.listen(port, (error) => {
	    if (error) {
	        console.error(error);
	    } else {
	        console.info('==> ðŸŒŽ Open http://localhost:%s/ on your browser.',
	        3000);
	    }
	});
	```

	Essentially, this imports express and uses it to serve the `index.html`
	file for browser requests on `http://localhost:3000`.

1. Create a `index.html` page with some basic html.

1. Add a script in the `package.json` file to run the application:

	```
	"scripts": {
		â€¦
		"start": "node server.js"
	},
	â€¦
	```

1. You can now run the app with `npm start` command which we just defined and
you should see your index page on the browser.

## Getting some karma

Weâ€™ll be using karma to unit-test our react components. Letâ€™s get it wired in
before starting on react.

1. Run `npm install karma karma-chrome-launcher â€”D` (same as the `-â€”save-dev`
option) to save it as a dev dependency. Generally, test and reporting libraries
are dev dependencies.

    Running `./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start` should get a chrome browser up

1. Run `./node_modules/karma/bin/karma init` for the karma wizard and
	- [`mocha`] as our testing framework
	- `requirejs` *not* needed as weâ€™ll be using babel and webpack
	- choose `chrome` and any other browser you wish
	- add `"components/*.js"` and `"components/*-test.js"` for the location of
	our source and test files
	- skim through the rest
A `karma.conf.js` file should be generated

1. Weâ€™d need to add the [`mocha`] (test framework) and [`chai`] (assertion
library) test dependencies manually by running:

    `npm install mocha chai karma-mocha karma-chai -D`

    Edit the `package.json` file to add `chai` to accompany `mocha`.

	```
	â€¦
	frameworks: ['mocha', 'chai']
	â€¦
	```

1. Add a `test` script the `package.json`:
	```
	â€¦
	"test": "karma start",
	â€¦
	```

1. Now run `npm start` for some karma goodnessâ€¦ which will not be useful until
 a bit later. You should see a Chrome window launched. Stop the runner with
 `<ctrl+c>`.

## Webpack-ing /o\

(Urgh)

[Webpack] helps us bundle our javascript modules. It can be a difficult task due
to the various configurations and plugins webpack allows, but not to worry!
Letâ€™s go through what we need.

1. Add `webpack` to your project by running `npm install webpack -S`.

1. We can now create a configuration file `webpack.config.js` and fill it up
with:

	```
	module.exports = {
    entry: "./index.js",
    output: {
        path: `${__dirname}/public`,
        filename: "bundle.js"
		}
	};
	```

	This configuration tells webpack to bundle the `index.js` file and put it
	into the output path with the specified filename `public/bundle.js`.

	If we create a `index.js` file and add some Javascript:

	```
	console.log(â€˜I love cats!â€™)
	```

	and run `webpack`, a `public/bundle.js` bundled file should be created.

	If youâ€™d want a more in-depth introduction to webpack, [this][webpack
	tutorial] is a good one.

1. Letâ€™s go back to the `package.json` file to make sure that `webpack` is
invoked whenever we start our application.

	```
	"scripts": {
		â€¦
		"prestart": "webpack -d"
	},
	â€¦
	```

	The `-d` option does `--debug --devtool source-map --output-pathinfo`

	- `--debug` switches your loaders to debug mode
	- `source-map` devtool emits a [sourcemap], which allows us to map our
	compressed JS code back to its original position in a file. We should see
	results at the end of this section
	- `output-pathinfo` include comments with information about the modules and
	should not be used in production

1. After the configuration is set up, weâ€™ll need to (1) use express to serve
the bundled file, and also remember to (2) set the index page to use the file.

	```
	//server.js file
	app.use('/public', Express.static(`${__dirname}/public/`));

	app.use((req, res) => { â€¦
	```

	```
	//index.html file
	<body>
	    nothing here à² _à² 
	    <script src="/public/bundle.js"></script>
	</body>
	```

	**Important note**:

	When using express, be sure to add the static bundled file **above** the
	index page, otherwise youâ€™ll always receive the index page instead of any
	file that you need. This is because weâ€™ve set to serve the index file for
	every request.

	When you view the bundled file located at
	`http://localhost:3000/public/bundle.js`, we should be able to find this:

	```
	â€¦
	!******************!*\
	!*** ./index.js ***!
	\******************/
	â€¦
	```

	indicating original file location of the compressed code. This is the
	beauty of sourcemap.

## Babel

[Babel] allows us to use [ES2015â€™s features] and thatâ€™s quite sweet.

1. Add `babel` by running `npm install babel-core babel-loader -S`.

1. Add the loader to webpack config. The file should now look like this:
	```
	module.exports = {
		entry: './index',
		output: {
		path: `${__dirname}/public`,
		filename: 'bundle.js'
		},
		module: {
			loaders: [{
				test: /\.js$/,
				exclude: /node_modules/,
				loader: 'babel',
				query: {
				  presets: ['es2015']
			  }
		  }]
		}
  };
	```

1. Profit.

	Well, to see your profit, we can go to `index.js` and use ES2015â€™s template
	literals as an example. Edit the file to

	```
	const cats = ['tomtom', 'steaky', 'zorro'];
	const me = 'nat'
	console.log(`${me} love ${cats}`); // note the backticks
	```

	and run `npm start`. Youâ€™ll see that webpack does not complain about the
	usage of backticks, whereas without the loader youâ€™ll get an error, also
	you'll notice that there's some nice stuff in the console.

## Adding your first react component

1. Add the `react` dependency into our project by running `npm install react -S`.
